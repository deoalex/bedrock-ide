# To Do

# Features

+ update jQuery/jQuery UI or SymantecUI?
+ add Ace editor
+ recently edited files
+ get documentation out of the way
+ package a project as a zip file

# Issues

+ creating a plugin failed (could not create directory?)
  + did not load template data in edit window
+ could not write "blank file"
+ if we are running mod_perl then no path to BLMs (/var/www/share)

# Roadmap

+ git integration
