# HTTP::Server::Simple does not do anything special with STDERR.
# Since we have forked using the ->background() method it would be up
# the child (our listening server) to close STDERR and then reopen to
# maybe, say, a log file? Since we're using Log::Log4perl to do our
# logging here we'll take the advice of the FAQ above and tie *STDERR
# to our class in the post_setup_hook().  Since the post_setup_hook()
# is called for each request we probably only need to tie STDERR when
# we get the first request.
