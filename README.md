# Overview

This is the README file for the `bedrock-ide` project.

`bedrock-ide` is a companion project to the web development framework
Bedrock.  It is a intended to be used by developers in a development
environment.  `bedrock-ide` provides basic wiki-like editing of web
pages while maintaining versioning information on files that have been
"committed".

`bedrock-ide` is intended to be used by those learning Bedrock or
those interested in developing Bedrock applications using a
lightweight development framework.

Writing robust, secure, professional web applications most likely is
beyond the scope of what `bedrock-ide` is designed to provide,
however, with some intelligent feedback, Bedrock developers might be
able to help enhance this lightweight development environment.

Enjoy.
